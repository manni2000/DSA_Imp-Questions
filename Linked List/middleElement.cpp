// Create two pointers slow and fast and initialize them to a head pointer.
// Move slow ptr by one step and simultaneously fast ptr by two steps until fast ptr is NULL or next of fast ptr is NULL.
// When the above condition is met, we can see that the slow ptr is pointing towards the middle of Linked List and 
// hence we can return the slow pointer.
